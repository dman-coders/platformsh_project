# Although I want this action (type management)
#  to be taken care of by platformsh_project_ui,
# this route HAS to be present because the (metric)entity_add form contains
# logic that constructs a link to here before it decides whether a link is needed.
# @see EntityController::addPage()
# DSue to this, we cannot legally just add a metric without also
#  having the theoretical capability to add a metric_type.
